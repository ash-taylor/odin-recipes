    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">Rich and juicy British duck breast is the perfect canvas for a sticky-sweet drizzle of maple syrup and pomegranate molasses. 
    <br>You dish it up with spiced stewed lentils, full of fibre. Grilled seasonal vegetables and a dusting of nutty dukkah to finish it off. 
    <br>A feast for the eyes - and your bellies.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 duck breasts</li>
        <li>2 tbsp dukkah (Celery, Nuts, Peanuts, Sesame)</li>
        <li>2 garlic clove</li>
        <li>80g red split lentils</li>
        <li>2 tsp maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Mindful Chef Middle Eastern spice mix</li>
        <li>1 red onion</li>
        <li>1 handful of fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>200g passata</li>
        <li>1 red pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp pomegranate molasses</li>
        <li>1 chicken stock cube (Celery)</li>
        <li>1 courgette</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 240C / fan 220C / gas mark 8. Boil a kettle. Heat a medium frying pan with 1/2 tbsp oil on medium heat. 
            <br>Thinly slice the onion. Add the onion and cook for 5 mins, until softening. Meanwhile, finely chop or crush the garlic. 
            <br>Dissolve the stock cube in a jug with 400ml boiling water.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, cook for 1 min, then add the lentils, spice mix, stock and passata. Stir and cover with a lid. 
            <br>Simmer for 18-20 mins, until the lentils are cooked through. Add a splash of water if it gets too dry. 
            <br>Season with sea salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Cut a criss-cross pattern into the duck skin, careful not to cut through the flesh. Heat a medium frying pan on medium-high heat. 
            <br>Add the duck, skin-side down, and cook for 4 mins, until crispy. Season with sea salt. 
            <br>Transfer to a lined baking tray, skin-side up, and bake 8-10 mins, until cooked through. 
            <br>Remove and leave to rest before thinly slicing against the grain.</li>
        <li>Thinly slice the pepper. Slice the courgette into 1/2cm thick discs. Place on a lined baking tray and toss with 1/2 tbsp oil, 
            <br>a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Roast for 13-15 mins, until soft and golden.</li>
        <li>Finely chop the parsley and stir it through the lentils. Make the glaze; place the maple syrup and molasses in a bowl and stir.</li>
        <li>Serve the lentils topped with the roasted veg and duck. Drizzle the duck with the glaze and sprinkle with the dukkah.</li>
    </ol>
